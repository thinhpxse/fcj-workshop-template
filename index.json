This article introduces how Electronic Arts (EA) uses AWS to modernize its patching process, reduce update sizes, speed up downloads, and improve player experience.\nInitial Challenges: Slow and Inefficient Patching Traditional patching only compared files by name, so data moved between files was considered “completely new,” forcing players to re-download many gigabytes of data. Large block sizes used for client-side comparison (e.g., 64 KB) reduced the ability to reuse old data, causing patches to grow in size. Patch computation happened on players’ machines, taking many minutes or longer, especially for large games, negatively impacting user experience. The Solution: Known Version Patching (KVP) on AWS In August 2023, EA introduced Known Version Patching (KVP) — a server-side patching system running entirely on AWS.\nHow KVP Works: Each game version is downloaded and unpacked on AWS, and hashes are calculated for every version. The system compares hash metadata between the new version and all previous versions to precisely identify changed data. Incremental patches are generated, containing only the modified data. A coordinator microservice receives events when a new version is available and triggers the patching pipeline and parallel processing jobs. Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is used to run massive parallel jobs. Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) stores unpacked builds, enabling reuse and avoiding re-downloading or recalculating for older versions. Technical Architecture \u0026amp; Patching Workflow When a new version is available, a streaming system (e.g., Amazon MSK) sends notifications to trigger the pipeline. The coordinator service creates EKS jobs to download, extract, hash, compare metadata, and generate patches. Patches are uploaded to a CDN and distributed to players through the EA application. EFS caches unpacked builds, so future patches only compare changed parts — saving time and compute resources. EKS uses CPU affinity, autoscaling, and optimized scheduling to maximize cluster throughput. Benefits and Improvements Achieved Smaller patch sizes: Patches were reduced by up to ~80% by including only changed data. Faster download and installation: Players can download and install patches up to 3.6× faster. Improved player experience: Less waiting time and reduced frustration during updates. Cost and resource optimization: Leveraging AWS infrastructure allows elastic scaling instead of relying on players’ local machines. Faster development cycles: Automated patching significantly accelerates release and testing cycles. Conclusion By moving patch computation to AWS and applying the KVP system (EKS + EFS), EA achieved a major leap in game update efficiency: smaller, faster, more cost-effective, and more stable updates. Players receive patches more quickly, while EA reduces development time and infrastructure load.\nThis solution demonstrates the power of AWS in handling massive data workloads at global scale and delivering superior experiences for both developers and gamers.\n"},{"uri":"https://thinhpxse.github.io/fcj-workshop-template/3-blogstranslated/3.4-blog4/","title":"Blog 4","tags":[],"description":"","content":"\r⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference only.

This approach enables rapid migration, seamless scaling, and minimal application refactoring.\n(aws.amazon.com)\nWhen building a hybrid cloud architecture integrating EVS, AWS VPCs, on-premises data centers, and internet connectivity, it is critical to implement consistent network security. Centralized inspection, unified firewall policy management, and consolidated logging/monitoring are essential. AWS recommends AWS Network Firewall as the core inspection and protection layer.\n(aws.amazon.com)\nThis blog explains how to secure an Amazon EVS environment using AWS Network Firewall, applying a centralized inspection model across EVS clusters, VPCs, on-premises environments, and the internet.\nArchitecture Overview AWS Network Firewall acts as a transparent “bump-in-the-wire,” inserted via VPC or Transit Gateway routing, inspecting all traffic without requiring application-level changes. A typical architecture includes: EVS VPC, hosting the underlay VLAN subnets for VCF (management, vMotion, vSAN, NSX overlay, etc.). Workload VPCs (e.g., VPC01) where applications or services run. Ingress VPC with an Application Load Balancer for public traffic. Egress VPC with a NAT Gateway to centralize outbound internet access. Optional on-prem connectivity via AWS Direct Connect + Direct Connect Gateway.\n(aws.amazon.com) All traffic flows—EVS ↔ VPCs, VPC ↔ VPC, VPC ↔ on-prem, and VPC ↔ Internet—are inspected by AWS Network Firewall, covering both east-west and north-south traffic.\nKey Benefits Centralized firewall control across EVS, AWS VPCs, on-premises, and internet paths Unified enforcement of security policies across complex hybrid environments Centralized logging and monitoring for audit, compliance, and troubleshooting Implementation Steps (Summary) Create an AWS Transit Gateway\nDisable default association/propagation. Create two route tables:\nPre-inspection Post-inspection\n(aws.amazon.com) Attach EVS, workload VPCs, ingress/egress VPCs, and optional Direct Connect Gateway\nUse the Pre-inspection route table for all attachments.\nDeploy AWS Network Firewall using Transit Gateway integration\nAWS automatically provisions required resources (firewall endpoints, internal routing, etc.).\nSimplifies configuration and reduces operational overhead.\nUpdate route tables\nPre-inspection: Default routing directs traffic into the Firewall for inspection Post-inspection: Routes inspected traffic back to the appropriate VPC destinations Inside each VPC: Update ingress/egress routes so all flows traverse the firewall\n(aws.amazon.com) (Optional) Configure firewall rule groups and logging\nStateful rules (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS, FQDN filtering, east-west segmentation) Send flow logs and alert logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3 When configured correctly, all network flows—across EVS, AWS VPCs, on-prem, and the internet—are monitored and protected.\nAdvantages Over Traditional Security Approaches No application-level changes required; firewall operates transparently at the network layer Centralized management simplifies policy enforcement across multiple VPCs and VMware clusters Scales dynamically using AWS-managed infrastructure Unified logs streamline compliance, auditing, and incident analysis Conclusion This blog demonstrates how AWS Network Firewall can secure Amazon EVS by providing a centralized, scalable network inspection model. Traffic between EVS, workload VPCs, on-premises environments, and the internet is consistently monitored and enforced.\nOrganizations can migrate VMware workloads to AWS confidently—preserving the benefits of cloud scalability while maintaining strong network security, unified control, and comprehensive visibility.\n"},{"uri":"https://thinhpxse.github.io/fcj-workshop-template/3-blogstranslated/3.5-blog5/","title":"Blog 5","tags":[],"description":"","content":"\r⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference only.

This blog presents a reference pattern (originally implemented by a company) that uses Amazon API Gateway as the front layer to manage access to Amazon Bedrock services, providing enterprise-grade controls, while remaining transparent to client applications. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}\nAI Gateway Architecture Overview The reference architecture offers granular control over access to foundation models using fully managed AWS services; it\u0026rsquo;s transparent to clients and integrates seamlessly into existing enterprise environments. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}\nCore components:\nCustom domain routing (optional): using a DNS service (e.g. Amazon Route 53), so clients access the gateway via a company-specific domain rather than the default API Gateway domain. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} Amazon API Gateway: serves as the entry point for all calls to Bedrock — handles authorization, request throttling / quota management, lifecycle controls, and integrates with security tools (e.g. WAF). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} Authorizer (e.g. AWS Lambda Authorizer): validates authentication tokens (like JWT) or integrates with existing identity systems (or other API-Gateway auth mechanisms) to enforce access control per tenant/user. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} Integration Lambda (request forwarder): receives requests from API Gateway, signs them with AWS credentials (AWS Signature v4), forwards them to the correct Amazon Bedrock endpoint — preserving the original request details (parameters, action, etc.). This way, the gateway supports current and future Bedrock APIs without requiring updates to gateway code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} Amazon Bedrock: provides foundation models and generative-AI capabilities behind the gateway. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} This pattern ensures clients can use standard SDKs (e.g. boto3) to call Bedrock as usual, but every request first passes through the gateway for governance. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}\nDeploying \u0026amp; Testing the Gateway The blog provides deployment instructions using infrastructure-as-code (e.g. via AWS CloudFormation). Initial deployment can disable authorization to simplify testing (e.g. private/regional endpoint, no JWT validation). :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} After stack creation, you get outputs like GatewayUrl, VpcId, ApiId — which you can use to test the gateway from inside the VPC (for example using a CloudShell environment). :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13} Example code is provided (e.g. Python + boto3) to create a client that works through the gateway. This client sets up custom headers (including service endpoint prefix) but signs request at the gateway side, thus preserving compatibility with Bedrock SDK calls. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14} The blog shows how to call streaming APIs (e.g. for LLM inference) via gateway — since Amazon API Gateway now supports response streaming, responses can be delivered to clients in real-time as the model generates them. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15} Optionally, after basic validation, you can enable authorization (e.g. JWT token validation) by updating the CloudFormation stack parameter. Then re-deploy API Gateway to activate changes. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}\nAdditional Gateway Capabilities \u0026amp; Best Practices Using API Gateway plus this integration pattern gives you many enterprise-level controls:\nRate limiting \u0026amp; throttling / usage quotas: to control usage per tenant/user — important for multi-tenant SaaS or shared internal platforms. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17} Lifecycle management \u0026amp; canary releases: you can manage API versioning, gradually roll out new versions, use stage variables, and do safe deployments. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18} Security hardening: integrate with AWS WAF to filter common web threats. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20} Caching or prompt/response caching: for stable or repeated requests, to reduce cost and latency. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21} Content filtering / custom validation: in the Lambda integration layer, you can implement additional checks — e.g. filter sensitive content, sanitize inputs/outputs — as a second line of defense beyond Bedrock’s built-in safety mechanisms. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22} Benefits \u0026amp; Use-Cases This AI gateway pattern is particularly useful when you need:\nMulti-tenant access to LLM services — each tenant gets per-tenant quota, isolation, usage tracking Governance and control over generative AI usage (authorization, cost control, rate limiting) Seamless integration with existing enterprise identity/auth systems (e.g. via JWT, Cognito, custom authorizers) Transparent SDK compatibility — clients can still use Bedrock’s SDKs (e.g. boto3) as-is, without custom code changes Safe rollout and version control of AI APIs (canary deployments, staged rollout) In short — you get enterprise-grade controls + flexibility + scalability + ease of adoption.\nConclusion The “AI Gateway to Amazon Bedrock with Amazon API Gateway” pattern offers a robust, scalable, and secure architecture for deploying generative-AI services in production. By putting a fully managed gateway in front of Bedrock, organizations gain fine-grained control over who can access what, how much, and when — while preserving compatibility with existing tools and SDKs. It’s a powerful base for building multi-tenant AI services, internal AI-powered platforms, or scalable AI backends for customers.\nIf you want — I can also generate a diagram (ASCII or markdown) of the architecture for easier inclusion in your documentation. ::contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}\n"},{"uri":"https://thinhpxse.github.io/fcj-workshop-template/3-blogstranslated/3.6-blog6/","title":"Blog 6","tags":[],"description":"","content":"\r⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference only.

This blog explains how to build a priority-based message processing system using Amazon MQ, AWS App Runner, and Amazon DynamoDB — ensuring high-priority messages are processed first, while low-priority events are still handled reliably in the background.\n(aws.amazon.com)\nSolution Overview The system uses several AWS fully managed services to create a scalable, cost-efficient, and reliable priority-based processing architecture:\nAmazon MQ as the message broker supporting JMS priority queues, ensuring high-priority messages are delivered and processed first. AWS App Runner as the fully managed service that runs the message-processing application with automatic scaling based on load. Amazon DynamoDB as a storage layer for message metadata and processing status, including real-time updates via DynamoDB Streams.\n(aws.amazon.com) This solution enables:\nMultiple priority levels: High, Standard, Low High-priority messages immediately move to the queue and bypass delays Standard and low-priority messages can be delayed or queued behind higher-priority traffic Real-time UI updates for message status tracking Two-layer retry and DLQ handling for durability and fault tolerance\n(aws.amazon.com) Priority Flow \u0026amp; Key Processing Mechanics Message intake \u0026amp; priority classification\nThe backend assigns JMS priorities (e.g., High = 9, Standard = 4, Low = 0). For Standard/Low messages, the application can apply a delay before enqueueing.\n(aws.amazon.com) Amazon MQ queueing\nMessages are stored in Amazon MQ queues that support priority ordering. The broker ensures high-priority messages always get delivered first. AWS App Runner processing\nApp Runner hosts a containerized message processor that automatically scales with throughput. Each message is processed and its status is stored in DynamoDB. Real-time monitoring via WebSockets\nDynamoDB Streams push status changes to the UI through WebSockets, enabling users to track message progress live.\n(aws.amazon.com) Retries \u0026amp; fault handling\nFailed messages are retried based on configured policies. Messages that continue to fail after retry limits can be moved to a dead-letter queue (DLQ).\n(aws.amazon.com) Benefits \u0026amp; Use Cases 🔹 Key Benefits Guarantees that urgent, critical tasks are processed ahead of lower-priority work Fully managed architecture with minimal operational overhead Real-time updates improve user transparency and system observability Automatic scaling using App Runner — no servers or capacity planning required Reliable event-driven design with retries and DLQ for durability\n(aws.amazon.com) 📌 Ideal Use Cases Systems with mixed workloads: urgent vs. background tasks Order processing systems that include “rush” or “VIP” orders Real-time monitoring dashboards that show progress of submitted requests Workflows that require predictable handling of priority traffic Applications where reliability and processing transparency matter Recommendations \u0026amp; Design Notes Configure Amazon MQ queues to fully support priority ordering; JMS priority must be enabled at the broker level. For production workloads, prefer native delay mechanisms of Amazon MQ (such as scheduled delivery or message TTL) rather than doing delay logic inside the application. Use IAM least privilege for App Runner, giving it only the permissions required for MQ and DynamoDB. Place Amazon MQ in private subnets for better security; avoid public accessibility if not needed.\n(aws.amazon.com) Conclusion By combining Amazon MQ + AWS App Runner + Amazon DynamoDB, you can build a scalable, fault-tolerant, and priority-aware message processing system.\nHigh-priority messages are processed quickly, lower-priority messages are handled efficiently in the background, and users get real-time visibility into the processing lifecycle.\nThis design is ideal for systems requiring:\nmulti-level message prioritization real-time message status updates high availability \u0026amp; fault tolerance minimum operational burden It offers strong reliability, clear priority control, and operational simplicity — all powered by fully managed AWS services.\n"},{"uri":"https://thinhpxse.github.io/fcj-workshop-template/5-workshop/5.3-s3-vpc/5.3.1-create-gwe/","title":"Create a gateway endpoint","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Open the Amazon VPC console In the navigation pane, choose Endpoints, then click Create Endpoint: You will see 6 existing VPC endpoints that support AWS Systems Manager (SSM).

They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between your compute resources and AWS services without imposing availability risks. Compute resources running in VPC can access Amazon S3 using a Gateway endpoint. PrivateLink interface endpoints can be used by compute resources running in VPC or on-premises. Workshop overview In this workshop, you will use two VPCs.\n\u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; is for cloud resources such as a Gateway endpoint and an EC2 instance to test with. \u0026ldquo;VPC On-Prem\u0026rdquo; simulates an on-premises environment such as a factory or corporate datacenter. An EC2 instance running strongSwan VPN software has been deployed in \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; and automatically configured to establish a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel with AWS Transit Gateway. This VPN simulates connectivity from an on-premises location to the AWS cloud. To minimize costs, only one VPN instance is provisioned to support this workshop. When planning VPN connectivity for your production workloads, AWS recommends using multiple VPN devices for high availability.

Connect to EC2 with session manager For this workshop, you will use AWS Session Manager to access several EC2 instances. Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that allows you to manage your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.\nFirst cloud journey Lab for indepth understanding of Session manager.\nIn the AWS Management Console, start typing Systems Manager in the quick search box and press Enter: From the Systems Manager menu, find Node Management in the left menu and click Session Manager: Click Start Session, and select the EC2 instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud.

Upload file to S3 bucket with command aws s3 cp testfile.xyz s3://your-bucket-name. Replace your-bucket-name with the name of S3 bucket that you created earlier. You have successfully uploaded the file to your S3 bucket. You can now terminate the session.\nCheck object in S3 bucket Navigate to S3 console. Click the name of your s3 bucket In the Bucket console, you will see the file you have uploaded to your S3 bucket Section summary Congratulation on completing access to S3 from VPC. In this section, you created a Gateway endpoint for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to upload an object. The upload worked because the Gateway endpoint allowed communication to S3, without needing an Internet Gateway attached to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo;. This demonstrates the functionality of the Gateway endpoint as a secure path to S3 without traversing the Public Internet.\n"},{"uri":"https://thinhpxse.github.io/fcj-workshop-template/3-blogstranslated/","title":"Translated AWS Blog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"This section contains a list of AWS blogs that have been summarized and translated.\nBlog 1 - Learn About Machine Learning on AWS This blog introduces how AWS helps organizations build and operate Machine Learning workloads from basic to advanced levels. It covers the “Zero to ML” journey, MLOps concepts for managing ML lifecycles, and purpose-built infrastructure such as AWS Trainium and Inferentia. The article also highlights real-world case studies from Pinterest and Booking.com, as well as the SageMaker Immersion Day workshop that demonstrates end-to-end ML implementation in near-production environments.\nBlog 2 - Revolutionizing Telecom Revenue Assurance with AWS AI-Driven Framework This blog explains how AWS applies AI/ML and Generative AI to modernize Revenue Assurance (RA) systems in the telecommunications industry. It focuses on a three-layer architecture (Amazon SageMaker, Amazon Bedrock, and Amazon Q) and highlights intelligent revenue-leakage detection, predictive risk analysis, and automated remediation. Real-world use cases include 5G services, partner settlements, and real-time usage reconciliation.\nBlog 3 - Electronic Arts Streamlines Game Patching with AWS This article describes how Electronic Arts (EA) built a Known Version Patching (KVP) system on AWS to optimize game update delivery. The solution leverages Amazon EKS and Amazon EFS to precompute patches on the server side, reducing patch sizes by up to 80% and significantly accelerating download and installation times. This architecture improves both player experience and operational efficiency.\nBlog 4 - Securing Amazon EVS with AWS Network Firewall This blog demonstrates how to secure Amazon Elastic VMware Service (EVS) environments using AWS Network Firewall. The architecture applies a centralized inspection model with AWS Transit Gateway, enabling inspection of both north-south and east-west traffic. The solution provides centralized firewall management, logging, and monitoring, and is well suited for hybrid cloud environments.\nBlog 5 - Building an AI Gateway to Amazon Bedrock with Amazon API Gateway This article presents an AI Gateway architecture that places Amazon API Gateway in front of Amazon Bedrock. The solution allows organizations to enforce access control, quotas, rate limits, and cost governance when using foundation models. It supports multi-tenant environments and enables enterprise-scale generative AI deployments with strong security and observability.\nBlog 6 - Priority-Based Message Processing with Amazon MQ and AWS App Runner This blog explains how to build a priority-based message processing system using Amazon MQ, AWS App Runner, and Amazon DynamoDB. The architecture ensures that critical messages are processed ahead of lower-priority workloads while maintaining reliability and scalability. It supports real-time status updates, retry mechanisms, and dead-letter queues, making it suitable for enterprise-grade, event-driven applications.\n"},{"uri":"https://thinhpxse.github.io/fcj-workshop-template/5-workshop/5.3-s3-vpc/","title":"Access S3 from VPC","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Using Gateway endpoint In this section, you will create a Gateway eendpoint to access Amazon S3 from an EC2 instance.

Connectivty from your on-premises environment to the cloud can be provided by AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Interface endpoints allow you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink. These services include some AWS services, services hosted by other AWS customers and partners in their own VPCs (referred to as PrivateLink Endpoint Services), and supported AWS Marketplace Partner services. For this workshop, we will focus on connecting to Amazon S3.

These IP addresses are attached to Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). AWS recommends using DNS to resolve the IP addresses for endpoints so that downstream applications use the latest IP addresses when ENIs are added to new AZs, or deleted over time.\nIn this section, you will create a forwarding rule to send DNS resolution requests from a simulated on-premises environment to a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone. This section leverages the infrastructure deployed by CloudFormation in the Prepare the environment section.\nCreate DNS Alias Records for the Interface endpoint Navigate to the Route 53 management console (Hosted Zones section). The CloudFormation template you deployed in the Prepare the environment section created this Private Hosted Zone. Click on the name of the Private Hosted Zone, s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com: Create a new record in the Private Hosted Zone: Record name and record type keep default options Alias Button: Click to enable Route traffic to: Alias to VPC Endpoint Region: US East (N. Virginia) [us-east-1] Choose endpoint: Paste the Regional VPC Endpoint DNS name from your text editor (you saved when doing section 4.3) Click Add another record, and add a second record using the following values. Click Create records when finished to create both records. Record name: *. Record type: keep default value (type A) Alias Button: Click to enable Route traffic to: Alias to VPC Endpoint Region: US East (N. Virginia) [us-east-1] Choose endpoint: Paste the Regional VPC Endpoint DNS name from your text editor The new records appear in the Route 53 console:\nCreate a Resolver Forwarding Rule Route 53 Resolver Forwarding Rules allow you to forward DNS queries from your VPC to other sources for name resolution. Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution. The dig command will return the IP addresses assigned to the VPC Interface endpoint running in VPC Cloud (your IP\u0026rsquo;s will be different): dig +short s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com The IP addresses returned are the VPC endpoint IP addresses, NOT the Resolver IP addresses you pasted from your text editor. The IP addresses of the Resolver endpoint and the VPC endpoint look similar because they are all from the VPC Cloud CIDR block.\nNavigate to the VPC menu (Endpoints section), select the S3 Interface endpoint. Click the Subnets tab and verify that the IP addresses returned by Dig match the VPC endpoint: Return to your shell and use the AWS CLI to test listing your S3 buckets: aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Terminate your Session Manager session: In this section you created an Interface endpoint for Amazon S3. This endpoint can be reached from on-premises through Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints simulated forwarding DNS requests from on-premises to a Private Hosted Zone running the cloud. Route 53 inbound Endpoints recieved the resolution request and returned a response containing the IP addresses of the VPC interface endpoint. Using DNS to resolve the endpoint IP addresses provides high availability in-case of an Availability Zone outage.\n"},{"uri":"https://thinhpxse.github.io/fcj-workshop-template/5-workshop/5.5-policy/","title":"VPC Endpoint Policies","tags":[],"description":"","content":"When you create an interface or gateway endpoint, you can attach an endpoint policy to it that controls access to the service to which you are connecting. A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint. If you do not attach a policy when you create an endpoint, AWS attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service through the endpoint.\nYou can create a policy that restricts access to specific S3 buckets only. This is useful if you only want certain S3 Buckets to be accessible through the endpoint.\nIn this section you will create a VPC endpoint policy that restricts access to the S3 bucket specified in the VPC endpoint policy.\nConnect to an EC2 instance and verify connectivity to S3 Start a new AWS Session Manager session on the instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. From the session, verify that you can list the contents of the bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC: aws s3 ls s3://\\\u0026lt;your-bucket-name\\\u0026gt; The bucket contents include the two 1 GB files uploaded in earlier.\nCreate a new S3 bucket; follow the naming pattern you used in Part 1, but add a \u0026lsquo;-2\u0026rsquo; to the name.

AWS CLI actions targeted to your original S3 bucket failed because you applied a policy that only allowed access to the second bucket you created. AWS CLI actions targeted for your second bucket succeeded because the policy allowed them. These policies can be useful in situations where you need to control access to resources through VPC endpoints.\n"},{"uri":"https://thinhpxse.github.io/fcj-workshop-template/5-workshop/","title":"Workshop","tags":[],"description":"","content":"\r⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference purposes only.
