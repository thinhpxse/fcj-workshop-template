### Objectives for this week:

* Understand system optimization methods when operating on AWS.  
* Grasp the key Operations tool groups: Monitoring, Automation, IaC, Resource Optimization, Cost Management.  
* Practice with CloudWatch, Systems Manager, IAM, Resource Tags, and Amazon EBS automation.  
* Be ready to optimize performance, cost, and security in real AWS environments.

### Achievements:

* Understood the role of **Operations** in optimizing systems:
  - Automation (Lambda, Systems Manager)  
  - Advanced Monitoring (CloudWatch, Grafana)  
  - Standardized resource management using Tags  
  - Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation, CDK)  
  - Cost & performance optimization (EC2 right-sizing, billing tools)  
  - Reliability & backup optimization (EBS, DLM, Snapshot Automation)

* Gained detailed understanding of each key service this week:  
  - **AWS Lambda**: Automations, event-driven tasks  
  - **CloudWatch & Grafana**: Dashboards, metrics, logs, anomaly detection  
  - **IAM + Resource Tags**: Fine-grained permissions  
  - **Systems Manager + Session Manager**: Server access & management without SSH  
  - **CloudFormation & AWS CDK**: Repeatable, version-controlled infrastructure deployment  
  - **EC2 Resource Optimization**: Right-sizing, unused instance checks  
  - **VPC Flow Logs**: Network traffic monitoring for security & debugging
