### Objectives of This Week:

* Understand application modernization using Microservices, Serverless, and Event-driven architectures.
* Learn how to migrate from Monolith → Microservices and set up CI/CD for modern applications.
* Study and practice Serverless series (DevAx, Book Store, Document Management System).
* Gain knowledge of API Gateway, SAM, Cognito, AppSync, CloudFront, Amplify, DynamoDB in modern architectures.

### Achievements:

#### 🏗 1. Application Modernization Fundamentals
- Mastered the Monolith → Microservices model.  
- Understood how to refactor data, workflows, and architecture when migrating to microservices.  
- Learned how to build CI/CD pipelines for fast and reliable releases.

#### ⚡ 2. Event-Driven & Serverless Architecture
- Applied event-driven patterns using S3, SNS, SQS, Lambda, and EventBridge.  
- Implemented SPA Authentication with Amazon Cognito (User Pool, Identity Pool).  
- Integrated AWS AI Services into applications (Rekognition, Comprehend, etc.).

---

### 🟣 **Serverless – DevAx Series**
- Serverless backend architecture using Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.  
- Built scalable applications without server management.  
- Optimized performance and error handling using event-driven patterns.

---

### 🟢 **Serverless – Book Store Series**

#### Backend
- Used Lambda + S3 + DynamoDB for CRUD operations and business logic.  
- Routed API requests from API Gateway to Lambda.

#### Frontend
- Built UI to call serverless APIs.  
- Optimized state management, fetch, and re-rendering.

#### Deployment
- Deployed with **AWS SAM**: template.yaml, automated build & deploy.  
- Built complete CI/CD pipeline for serverless applications.

#### Authentication
- Used **Amazon Cognito** for sign-in, sign-up, and JWT tokens.

#### Advanced
- Configured custom domains + SSL using ACM + API Gateway.  
- Implemented event processing with SNS & SQS.  
- Monitored using CloudWatch: logs, metrics, and alarms.  
- Built GraphQL APIs with **AWS AppSync**.

---

### 🔵 **Serverless – Document Management System Series**

#### Backend & CRUD
- Implemented document CRUD with Lambda + DynamoDB.  
- Optimized partition keys and GSIs.

#### Storage & Auth
- Used AWS Amplify for Authentication, Storage, and Hosting.  
- Secured document upload and download.

#### Integration
- Connected frontend to backend using API Gateway.  
- Distributed content quickly and securely with Cloud
