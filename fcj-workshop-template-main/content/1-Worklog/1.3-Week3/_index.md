### Objectives for this week:

* Understand an overview of the services that support Migration on AWS.  
* Learn the workflow for migrating systems from On-premises or another Cloud to AWS.  
* Know the roles of each Migration service (DMS, SCT, VM Import/Export, Elastic Disaster Recovery…).  
* Prepare fundamentals for next week’s Migration hands-on exercises.

### Achievements:

* Gained an understanding of the entire set of services in the **Migrate to AWS** group, including:
  - AWS VM Import/Export  
  - AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)  
  - Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)  
  - AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery  
  - AWS Application Migration–related services (Coming Soon)

* Clearly understood the migration categories:
  - **VM Migration**: Moving virtual machines.  
  - **Database Migration**: Migrating databases + converting schemas.  
  - **Disaster Recovery**: Preparing systems for recovery after incidents.  
  - **Full Application Migration**: (upcoming services).

* Understood the purpose of each service:
  - **VM Import/Export** → Move VMs from VMware/Hyper-V to EC2.  
  - **DMS** → Migrate data with minimal downtime.  
  - **SCT** → Convert schemas when changing engines (Oracle → Aurora…).  
  - **Elastic Disaster Recovery** → Create ready-to-failover replicas.  
  - **Migration Hub** → Track the entire Migration project.  
  - **Application Migration Service** → Automatically convert On-prem machines to EC2.

* Took notes on the use cases of each service and the differences between Migration & Disaster Recovery.

* Prepared materials for next week’s Migration practice sessions.
