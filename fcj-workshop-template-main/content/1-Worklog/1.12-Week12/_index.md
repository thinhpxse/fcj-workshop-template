| Day | Task                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Material                        |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 2   | - Review all core services: EC2, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, IAM, VPC, Lambda, CloudWatch, CloudFront, API Gateway <br> - Define requirements and architecture for the final project                                                                      | 24/11/2025 | 24/11/2025      | <https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/>                              |
| 3   | - Start project deployment: <br>&emsp; + Design VPC, subnet, security groups <br>&emsp; + Configure S3, CloudFront, RDS/DynamoDB (depending on project)                                                       | 25/11/2025 | 25/11/2025      | <https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/>                              |
| 4   | - Continue project implementation: <br>&emsp; + Build backend using Lambda / API Gateway or EC2 (depending on architecture) <br>&emsp; + Connect database and process data <br>&emsp; + Integrate CloudWatch for monitoring | 26/11/2025 | 26/11/2025      | <https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/>                             |
| 5   | - Complete the project: <br>&emsp; + Add Cognito authentication if needed <br>&emsp; + Finalize CI/CD pipeline (CodePipeline/CodeBuild) <br>&emsp; + End-to-end system testing                  | 27/11/2025 | 27/11/2025      | <https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/>                   |
| 6   | - Write final report <br> - Prepare presentation (architecture, service selection rationale, cost, security) <br> - Summarize the entire learning journey and self-evaluate capabilities                                              | 28/11/2025 | 28/11/2025      | <https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/>                        |
