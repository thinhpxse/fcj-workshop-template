### Achievements:

#### 💰 1. Cost Savings
- Understood the differences between:
  - **Savings Plans**: Flexible, apply to multiple services (EC2, Fargate, Lambda).
  - **Reserved Instances (RI)**: Cheaper but tied to specific instance type and region.
- Learned how to choose 1-year or 3-year Savings Plans based on commitment level.

#### 📊 2. Cost Visualization & Analytics
- Used **Cost Explorer** to:
  - View daily/monthly spending.
  - Break down costs by service, tag, and account.
  - Detect cost spikes and anomalies.

- Created **Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)** to track detailed billing data.

#### 🔍 3. Cost Data Analysis with Glue & Athena
- Created Glue Crawlers to index CUR data.
- Queried CUR data with Athena to:
  - Analyze costs by tag/product.
  - Calculate total spending for EC2, S3, RDS, etc.
  - Build custom reports as needed.

- Understood how to use Athena + Glue as a mini BI system for real-time cost analysis.
