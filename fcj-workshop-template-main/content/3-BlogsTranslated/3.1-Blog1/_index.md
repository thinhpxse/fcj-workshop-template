# Let’s Architect! Learn About Machine Learning on AWS

Machine Learning (ML) is becoming essential for organizations wanting to make data-driven decisions, automate processes, and build intelligent applications. ML models are not static — they continuously improve as more data flows in, helping organizations adapt to business changes.

This blog highlights several AWS resources, architectures, workshops, and customer stories to help teams design, deploy, and scale ML workloads effectively.

## Zero to Machine Learning: Jump-Start Your Data-Driven Journey

A session from AWS re:Invent 2023 showing how organizations with limited resources (time, budget, expertise) can quickly start ML workloads on AWS.

Key ideas:
- Use analytics + ML to build end-to-end data pipelines.
- Apply low-code / no-code tooling to accelerate ML adoption.
- Leverage AWS services to reduce operational overhead and shorten time-to-value.

## Introduction to MLOps Engineering on AWS

MLOps extends DevOps practices to ML workloads and helps teams automate and manage the entire machine-learning lifecycle.

Core concepts include:
- Versioning data, models, experiments.
- Automated training, testing, and deployment pipelines.
- Monitoring model performance after deployment.
- Ensuring reliability and scalability of ML systems.

This section provides architecture patterns and best practices to adopt MLOps using AWS services.
