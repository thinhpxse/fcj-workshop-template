### [Blog 3 - Electronic Arts Streamlines Game Patching with AWS](3.3-Blog-EA-Patching/)
This article describes how Electronic Arts (EA) built a Known Version Patching (KVP) system on AWS to optimize game update delivery. The solution leverages Amazon EKS and Amazon EFS to precompute patches on the server side, reducing patch sizes by up to 80% and significantly accelerating download and installation times. This architecture improves both player experience and operational efficiency.

### [Blog 6 - Priority-Based Message Processing with Amazon MQ and AWS App Runner](3.6-Blog-Priority-Messaging/)
This blog explains how to build a priority-based message processing system using Amazon MQ, AWS App Runner, and Amazon DynamoDB. The architecture ensures that critical messages are processed ahead of lower-priority workloads while maintaining reliability and scalability. It supports real-time status updates, retry mechanisms, and dead-letter queues, making it suitable for enterprise-grade, event-driven applications.
